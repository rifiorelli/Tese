%%      You generally cover three things in the Conclusions section, and each of these usually merits a
%   separate subsection:
% 1 Conclusions
%       Conclusions are not a rambling summary of the thesis: they are short, concise statements of the
%   inferences that you have made because of your work. It helps to organize these as short numbered
%   paragraphs, ordered from most to least important. All conclusions should be directly related to
%   the research question stated in Section 4.
% 2 Summary of Contributions
%       The Summary of Contributions will be much sought and carefully read by the examiners. Here
%   you list the contributions of new knowledge that your thesis makes. Of course, the thesis itself
%   must substantiate any claims made here. There is often some overlap with the Conclusions, but
%   thatâ€™s okay. Concise numbered paragraphs are again best. Organize from most to least important.
% 3 Future Research
%       The Future Research subsection is included so that researchers picking up this work in future
%   have the benefit of the ideas that you generated while you were working on the project. Again,
%   concise numbered paragraphs are usually best.

    The use of \emph{green ict} applied to data centers can be a very useful strategy in different scenarios. Using the database of components resulted from this thesis work it can be very effective for what it is proposed to be: offering a way to compare the energy consumption of the computer components in one single place.
