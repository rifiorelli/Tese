    The objective of this chapter is to describe the designed component's database and evaluate it in comparison with measured data and data obtained from the components' manufacturer. The result of this evaluation will determine the adequacy of power consumption data provided by the database as a way to estimate the power consumption of different machine configurations.

\subsection{Component's Database} \label{sec4:component_database}
    The component's database will be described in terms of its relations. For each relation its semantic meaning will be explained along with the included data and the source of this data. The database schema is present in Appendix~\ref{app:database schema}.

    \subsubsection*{Relations: Classification}
        For a better understanding of the relations between included in the database it was created a set of categories. The four relation's category used are 1CAT, 2CAT, 3CAT and DEVICE. In this hierarchical disposition each component is classified in three levels by the relations 1CAT, 2CAT and 3CAT and then uniquely identified by the DEVICE relation. This classification follows the one present in the website analyzed by the crawler.

%XXX Seria legal criar uns buletts com
        \paragraph*{Relation 1CAT}%XXX nao entendi o que tem que colocar nessa primeira categoria...
            This is the first level of classification, it is a general one, because it just states the final usage of the component. As the components used in the database are computer components they will be defined like that in this first level.

        \paragraph*{Relation 2CAT}
            This relation fits the component into one of the main devices of a computer architecture. These are the following: processors, main memory, mass storage device, networking devices, CD/DVD player, mainboard, etc.

        \paragraph*{Relation 3CAT}
            The component is classified in the last level to provide contextual information about its usage. Processors, for example, are defined either as boxed or directly available in an OEM computer configuration. Memory can be used for servers, workstations or notebooks. Network devices can be LAN cards or networking equipment such as routers. Finally, mass storage devices are separated by technology, which can be hard-disk or flash-based.

        \paragraph*{Relation DEVICE}
            The last level of these categories is the identification of each component by an unique MPN code. This is the central relation in the database connecting pricing, benchmark and characteristic relations associated to specific components. The MPN information stored here was obtained with the use of the WEBSPHINX crawler over the SiSoftware shopping site. This device relation uses MPN as its key and associates for each component the three previous classifications, the component model/name and the date in which it was inserted in the database.
            
    \subsubsection*{Relations: Characteristics}
        This set of relations associates each component with its specifications, provided by the manufacturer. As SiSoftware Sandra provides these, it was be preferred source for this kind of data. Other sources such as CPU-Z reports and component datasheets were used in case the information could not be found in Sandra.

        \paragraph*{Relation DEVICE\_CHARACTERISTIC}
            This determines the value of the characteristic being described. The value in CHAR\_VALUE can be for example number of cores or clock frequency for a processor, disk rotation or average bandwidth for a hard drive or size and bandwidth for main memory. The attribute CHAR\_ID is linked to the following relation in order to define the type of the characteristic.
            
        \paragraph*{Relation CHARACTERISTIC}
            Each characteristic, other than a value associated in the previous relation, should be described in terms of type and measurement unit. One example may be the clock frequency which is measured in MHz. In this relation the attribute CHAR\_NAME would be ``clock frequency'', the attribute CHAR\_UM would be ``MHz'' and the DESCRIPTION attribute would explain the meaning of the characteristic.
            
        \paragraph*{Relation SOURCE}
            For each component, the source is the location from which the information was retrieve. For instance, SiSoftware Sandra, the web or other softwares such as CPU-Z.
            
    \subsubsection*{Benchmark Relations}
        In SANDRA there were two types of benchmarks analyzed: single-value or graph-based. Single-value benchmarks provide one value as output, such as power consumption and average performance. Graph-based benchmarks generate a graph by adjusting one parameter and measuring the value of another one. Examples are clock frequency per workload for a processor and bandwidth per data block size for main memory.

        \paragraph*{Relation BENCHMARK}
            This is the main benchmark relation. It identifies a single benchmark type by giving it a name, measure unit, description and type (attribute MULTIPLE), which can be 0 for single-value or 1 for graph-based. Depending on the MULTIPLE attribute, the benchmark will be either referenced by the DEVICE\_BENCHMARK or the BENCHMARK\_POINT relations.

        \paragraph*{Relation DEVICE\_BENCHMARK}
            This relation stores one single-value for a benchmark. It also references both the benchmark and the component.
            
        \paragraph*{Relation BENCHMARK\_POINT}
            This relation stores a set of values provided as the output of the benchmark. It also references both the benchmark and the component.            

    \subsubsection*{Relation PRICE}
        In the ``shopping'' session of Sandra's website, it is possible to retrieve information about the price and also the MPN of the components. The suggested prices were shown together with a rating. The rating represents the number of users that suggested a price for the component and the higher it is, greater the credibility of the price information.
                        
\subsection{Data insertion process} \label{sec4:data_insertion}
    % explicar que a gente pegou as coisas e separou por tabelas, tentar nao ser redundate com o que teve no cap3
    % colocar referencia pra tabelas em XXXXXX
    The database of components was created by extracting information from the database provided by SiSoftware Sandra and it contains information about component's characteristics and benchmarks' results. However, this information was not uniformerly stored as represented by Figure~\ref{fig:database_schema}, but instead as a set of independent relations without a central component repository. The original schema is described in Appendix~\ref{app:sandra_benchmark_table_schema} and it contains the extracted tables provided by SiSoftware SANDRA.
    
    As SiSoftware Sandra did not provide a centralized component's database, to make the insertion of the new component's database possible a new relation would have to be created with an association of each component with its respective MPN. The method used to that end was explained in section~\ref{sec3:websphinx}.
    
    The steps taken to populate the final database are, as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The Sandra database information was extracted into the relations shown in Appendix~\ref{app:sandra_benchmark_table_schema}.
        \item The component's MPN relation was created and populated with the output of the procedure described in section~\ref{sec3:websphinx}.
        \item Each component in the extracted Sandra database was assigned to a unique MPN and linked.
        \item The information from the Sandra database was exported to the component database whose schema is in Figure~\ref{fig:database_schema}.
    \end{itemize}
    
\subsection{Measurements and Result Analysis} \label{sec4:measurements}    
    
    The final task was to compare benchmarks executed in a number of machines and compare their results with measurements with the power measurement device. A standard procedure was defined and then applied to a set of computers. The parameters measured and benchmarked are described in the following paragraphs.

    \paragraph*{Measurements}
        For each computer the tool showed in Section~\ref{sec3:energy_measurement_instrument} was used and a measure of three parameters was made:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The power of the computer with monitor powered on in idle mode, i.e. without running any user processes.
            \item The power of the computer with monitor off also in idle mode.
            \item The power of the computer with monitor on and processor fully stressed while executing a Sandra processor benchmark.
        \end{itemize}
            
        The measurement results are described in Appendix~\ref{app:measures_toolino}.
            
    \paragraph*{Benchmarking}
        The following Sandra benchmarks were then executed in each computer:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Processor arithmetic performance benchmark, which provided the power consumption of the processor.
            \item Cache and memory benchmark, which provided the total power consumption of set processor, chipset and memory.
            \item Physical disk benchmark, that shows the power consumption of the computer's hard drive.
        \end{itemize}
            
        The benchmark results are described in Appendix~\ref{app:measures_toolino}.
            
    \paragraph*{Component Specifications}
        The last set of information used in the benchmark result analysis are the specifications (datasheets) provided by the  manufacturers.
        % comparacao power benchmark sandra e power datasheet componente (nominal)
        As a way to validate the power consumption data provided by the processor arithmetic benchmark, the power measured by the benchmark was compared with the nominal power described in the processor specification. This comparation may be found in Appendix~\ref{app:measures_toolino}.
                        
            
\section{Results} \label{sec4:results}
%TODO falar que aqui a gente vai explicar os resultados de todos os métodos
%TODO 
    In this section the data obtained with the benchmarks, measurements and component specifications will be confronted in several ways to determine the accuracy of the power consumption information measured by the benchmarks.
    
    \subsection{Processor power} \label{sec4:processor_power}
        In the first place, a simple analysis regarding the coherence of the data obtained from the processor performance benchmark was made. It consisted in the comparation of two values:
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Processor power measured by the processor arithmetic performance benchmark.
            \item Nominal processor power provided by the manufacturer specifications.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Both results are listed in --REFERENCIA TABELA--. From it, it can be seen that X benchmark measures are not coherent with the processor specifications as they show a higher power consumption than the nominal processor power.
        
    \subsection{Power of the set processor, chipset and  memory} \label{sec4:processor_power}
        
        Sandra provided the aggregate power of the set processor, chipset and memory through the cache and memory benchmark. Its results were then compared with a combination of the conducted measurements and an estimate of the notebooks PSU power consumption.
        
        \paragraph*{PSU power consumption}
            
            The power source for the notebooks can usually provide up to 100W, but it hardly does so. Instead, its consumption is measured as a function of the total power consumption of the notebook and PSU and of the PSU efficiency.
            
            This function can be stated as:
            \begin{equation}
                \text{ PSU power consumption } = (1 - \text{ PSU efficiency }) \cdot \text{ measured consumption }
                \label{psu_consumption}
            \end{equation}

        \paragraph*{}
