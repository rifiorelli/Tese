%     This is a general introduction to what the thesis is all about – it is ust a description of the contents
% of each section. Briefly summarize the question (you will be stating the question in detail later),
% some of the reasons why it is a worthwhile question, and perhaps give an overview of your main
% results. This is a birds-eye view of the answers to the main questions answered in the thesis (see
% above).

\section{Motivation} \label{sec1:motivation}
% Mostrar o que levou a realiza��o do trabalho, e as motiva��es para que o problema seja entendido.
% Situa��o do leitor no contexto
%O greenict tem sido muito importatne para o mundo, as empresas, depois da crise economica, comecaram a ver que é importante, pois, reduz muitos custos, além de contribuirem apra o meio ambiente\ldots bla bla bla

    The planet is threatened by global warming. The progressive pressure we impose to the environment, has already exceeded the limits imposed by the available natural resources. In actual figures, it can be stated that 125\% of the renewal capacity of natural resources is currently consumed. If the growth continues at this rate, in 2050 we will be consuming more than twice the production capacity of the planet Earth~\cite{Townsend:2002:2050}. 
    
    The search for environmental friendly solutions is spreading throughout all the economic sectors and consumers have become more aware of environmental issues and thus opt for the products and services of companies which have proven to be more ecologically friendly. Moreover, it is possible to say that soon we will enter in a green trend - if we are not already in it - where environmental policies will be executed without economical or political pressure, but rather as a necessary measure sustainability of the business. In a following phase companies will perceive green solutions as a competitive differential instead of a necessary preoccupation thereby giving the green issue a push towards being part of the business.
        
    In the last years, the concept - and idea - of Green ICT has been increasing, it is the mantra of "Going Green". A study from Info-Tech Research Group~\cite{info-tech07}, made in U.S.A., believes that the increasing interest to adopt green solution will start to generate more meaningful actions. However, there exists a big gap between what companies think it is a green ICT solution and what they are really doing about it. The study predicts ``Info-Tech expects continued interest in green IT strategies and significant traction among those initiatives that both reduce waste and reduce cost. As enterprises begin to translate concern for green into practice, we expect higher spending in many leading areas, such as data center design, virtualization and
consolidation, print optimization, and system management tools''.
	
	The most difficult phase when applying a new solution is going against the inertia of the company. In this case, the state of being at rest is not applying a green solution and it is needed the force and influence for pushing forward this idea, as soon as the first step is taken the others come with time. A critical issue for taking the first step apropos the green initiative is the allocation of budget. Before the economical crisis IT resources could be larger, but now it has been more difficult to manage the budget towards new initiatives. Therefore, the Green ICT budget should reflect what the company is expecting from the solution.
	
	As a new trend, there exists a high interest, yet low adoption of green initiatives. Nonetheless, companies have reached the consensus that it is extremely necessary to start changing their minds towards green thoughts. So, leading industries and governments have started a proactive going green idea and offering green solutions in order to create a market around it. This include the allocation of a significant amount of money in researches in the area. Besides that, it is important to notice that as soon as the information in the direction of well management of the energy consumed start to spread, companies will start to be more worried about it. And the first step will be to start to count environmental harm and power consumption in the TCO accountancies.
	
	Furthermore, there are indirect benefits when adopting a Green ICT solutions. The most important benefit is the reduction of cost related to the energy consumed in a efficient way. Some studies says that the costs with power and cooling in data centers can reach 20\% of the IT cost. Another benefit is that Green ICT can be used as a marketing strategy, with the growing popularity, vendor have started to put green labels on their products and consumers also started to seek for green products in contrast to traditional ones.

%TODO  OPTIONAL
%     A brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially if your work spans
% two or more traditional fields. That means that your readers may not have any experience with
% some of the material needed to follow your thesis, so you need to give it to them. A different title
% than that given above is usually better; e.g., ”Frammis Algebra.”
