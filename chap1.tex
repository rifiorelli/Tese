\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap1:introduction}
Purpose of the study.
%     This is a general introduction to what the thesis is all about – it is ust a description of the contents
% of each section. Briefly summarize the question (you will be stating the question in detail later),
% some of the reasons why it is a worthwhile question, and perhaps give an overview of your main
% results. This is a birds-eye view of the answers to the main questions answered in the thesis (see
% above).

\section{Motivation} \label{sec1:motivation}

% Situa��o do leitor no contexto
%O greenict tem sido muito importatne para o mundo, as empresas, depois da crise economica, comecaram a ver que é importante, pois, reduz muitos custos, além de contribuirem apra o meio ambiente\ldots bla bla bla

%    The planet is threatened by global warming. We impose each day even more pressure to the environment, exceeding a sustainable life. Each year it is consumed 25\% over the production capacity of natural resources by nature. Therefore, if it continues in this rate, in 2050 we will be consuming more than twice the production capacity of the planet Earth\cite{Townsend:2002:2050}. 
%    The research for more environmental friendly solutions is spreading throughout all the economic sectors - consumers have required more and more sustainable solutions to the companies. Moreover, it is possible to say that soon we will enter in a green trend - if we are not in yet - and the environmental questions will be executed without economical or politics pressure, but just a relevant factor to the sustainability of the business. The CIOs started to perceive that green solutions will, in the future, increase the quantity and quality of business, or even that this strategy of doing business will overtake competitive advantage for deals.

%    In the last years, the concept - and idea - of Green ICT has been increasing. 
    
% \section{Terminology Clarification} \label{sec1:terminology_clarification}
%TODO  OPTIONAL
%     A brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially if your work spans
% two or more traditional fields. That means that your readers may not have any experience with
% some of the material needed to follow your thesis, so you need to give it to them. A different title
% than that given above is usually better; e.g., ”Frammis Algebra.”
