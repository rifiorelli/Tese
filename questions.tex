\chapter*{Questions and Doubts}
    In order not to have any text not related to the thesis in the middle of the text and maybe, in the final version nobody sees it, I created this file, like that, we can put some information here and delete it in the last version. Of course, these are not the only issues related to the thesis, but it is better to have a centralized way to do that.

    The questions are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Section~\ref{sec3:components_database} or Appendix~\ref{app:sandra_benchmark_table_schema}] Do we need to insert all tables here, in appendix, or where do we need to insert the tables? Or just the database schema? These tables were taken from the SANDRA Access file.
	\item[Section~\ref{sec3:measures}] special attention to the schema of the database with measures with the measurement tool provided.
	\item[Figure~\ref{fig:power_consumption_harddrive}] Can we insert a picture with the Toms hardware logo, or do we need to port it and provide the source?
	\item[Figure~\ref{fig:installed_base_virtualized_servers}] same as above.
	\item[]
\end{description}
