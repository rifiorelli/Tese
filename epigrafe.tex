\textit{``It's the only home we know. Yet everyday, we take the earth for granted.\\
        Everytime we leave the lights on, we are doing the earth harm.\\
        When we forget to turn off our computers, energy is also wasted.\\
        But together we can help make the world a greener place, one simple act at a time.\\
        Because when it comes to the environment, small changes can make a world of difference.'',
